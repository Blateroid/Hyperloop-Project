# Hyperloop-Project

For my senior design project, my group and I decided to work in the phase 2 of the Hyperloop pod project that a previous group started. Phase 1 was based on proving the concept and phase 2 was based on improving the concept and make it more autonomous by creating a control system.

We started working with C code, but then transitioned to Python. In this Github repository, you can find both types of code. However, the c code version is not finished.

The main program for each language is called Hyperloop, that is the program that you have to run. Just make sure you download the other files and have them in the same folder when you run it. 

As well, if you are going to try to run it you will need the sensors we used, here is the list:
BMP388 Barometric Pressure and Temperature Sensor
BerryIMUv3-10DOF
Ultra-sonic distance sensor
